# Chessdrez
A React Chess Game

## Why

I like chess, but not enough to make a React chess game ðŸ™ƒ

The objective of this *hobby* project is to practice:

* HTML, CSS, JS
* Git
* Github
* React
* Webpack (no [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) here!)
* Node backend (Express)
* Typescript
* Deploy a web application
* Debugging (vs code)
* Testing (Jest, RTL)

and more!

**Note**: this project is for now "live", meaning, when I want to test or learn something new, I will think of a new feature to implement. 

<hr>

## Install and run?

**In dev mode**, with hot reloading to see changes live:

`npm install`

`npm run local-start`

That will start the React app in port 3000 (http://localhost:3000/). The server will be on port 8080.

**In prod mode** (or a prod attempt, anyway):

`npm install`

`npm run start`

The application will then be available in http://localhost:8080/.

### Disclaimer

The words *practice*, *hobby*, *test*, *learn*... might give a clue already ðŸ˜œ

If you clone this repo, please know that code is not (yet?) bullet-proof, there are some bug that need to be solved. Also, functionality is being added.

Some of this bugs or needed features, I am aware of. Others, I would appreciate if you let me know!
